-----------------------

This web application allows for the visualization of spatial and temporal trends in five years of violent crime data (2014-2018) in Washington, DC. An interactive map, a line chart, and a series of time wheels allow for dynamic visualization of violent crime patterns across the city's geography, as well as over the course of 24-hour periods and a calendar year.

The application also includes a broad analysis of potential relationships between socioeconomic factors and crime incidents using linear regression models. Socioeconomic data is pulled from the Census Bureau's 2007-2012 American Community Survey, 5-year estimates. Five violent crime types (robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon, homicide, sex abuse, and all total violent crimes) are analyzed against percent below poverty line, percent unemployment, percent housing unit vacancy, and total population at the block group level.

Our objective in this project was to cut through a dense and lengthy dataset to allow for easy-to-use, customizable visualizations of trends.
